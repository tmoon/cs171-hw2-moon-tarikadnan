# part 1:
- These are different in many ways, including their dimensions such as the number of commits, users, breanches etc. The visualization could show: commits, timeline, number of commits, user info, amount of commit, collaboration etc.
- commits, timeline, number of commits, user info, collaboration
- We choose the collboration as the most important point and using the hive plot we will visualize that.

# Part 2:
- commits, timeline, number of commits, user info, collaboration. Here we use collaboration as the strongest.
- It is necessary if we want to actually have an idea of the amount of commit an user did. However, if the number of added lines is not large we could choose not to show that commit.

- Having a row for each contributor makes the graph simpler. However, we could try to achieve the effect with colors and make the visualization more compact.
- Node-link diagram seems to be most appropriate here because here are talking about relations and collaborations,

# part 3:
- We had two ideas, one was using line graph to show the contricution of individual user another was to show the collaboration using a hive plot. We choose the hive plot because it not only shows the commit timescale, it shows the collaoboration very clearly, which could be a valuable information. (Please check the sketch.png for the sketch).
