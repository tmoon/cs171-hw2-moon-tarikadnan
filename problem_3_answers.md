1. They need to reptresent the commit information, time information, and the information about the authors.
2. For big project we found that there are a lot more users that the small projects (we can only see the last 30 commits). 
3. This makes the graph vertically massive. 
4. For more complex data we need to be more careful about just representing the graphs linearly. For example, for github visualization when the project was old, and had a lot of active users, it was really hard to see the big picture. So we need to make the visualization more interactive (possibly with sliders and filters).
